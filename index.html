      <h5 class="w3-center">Serving the Triangle since 2014</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Our team consists of Jenna, Jim, and Ross.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Jenna-Leigh Hannah was born and raised in Durham, North Carolina. She attended high school at Saint Mary's School in Raleigh and then received her bachelor's degree from Michigan State University. She currently resides in Chapel Hill. Jenna prides herself in her ability to find properties that are custom-tailored to her clients' needs. First-time home buyers find it particularly easy to work with Jenna as she knows the ins and outs of what it takes to find that first special home. She also has at her fingertips the knowledge of excellent financing options for first-time buyers. Many former renters have found that Jenna-Leigh can put them into their own home at a price that is similar to the rent they are paying, and avail them of the tax advantages that come with home ownership. On the seller's side, she works hard to get you the best return on your home investment. She will support your listing with additional advertising and open houses to make your sale presentation the best in your neighborhood.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Jim Taylor has lived in the Triangle area for over 30 years and prides himself in his vast knowledge of the surrounding area. He received his Political Science/Public Administration degree from Michigan State University and, for a brief period of time, attended law school in Michigan. He resides in Durham, with his wife Janet, who works for Duke Clinical Research Institute. Jim specializes in negotiation. For over 20 years, Jim represented several Fortune 500 companies and was integral in completion of many multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts. Jim brings his negotiation skills to the table for all Hannah-Taylor Team clients. He will work for you, whether you are the buyer or the seller, to get the best result possible.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Ross Hannah was born and raised in Concord, North Carolina and moved to Raleigh in 2003 to attend North Carolina State University. He then realized that the Triangle is where he wanted to stay. Upon graduating from North Carolina State University, Ross began working in the field of technology, and through his personal real estate transactions, Ross saw opportunities to make real estate transactions more efficient by leveraging technology, thus he was motivated to start working in real estate in order to help buyers and sellers accomplish their goals more efficiently. Ross is the team's technology guru and enjoys showing properties on nights and weekends. He is also very knowledgeable with investment properties, as he has invested in the Triangle himself and is a member of several Triangle-based real estate investment organizations.</p>

      <h4>They were amazing! Always responded within minutes if contacted by email, always available on the phone no matter what time we needed them. They were very helpful and explained very clearly the entire process, showed us all the houses we wanted, and finally helped us buy our home. The most honest and reliable real estate team you could find.</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Christian B., First-Time Home Buyer</p><br>

      <h4>What can I say? I was in a seller's market when I bought my house. This means multiple offers and bidding wars. Even though I was facing this unfortunate circumstance as a buyer, Jenna helped me get through. Jenna truly cares about her clients. There were numerous occasions where she could help me close "Okay" and "Questionable" deals for an easy profit, yet she went extra mile to help me find the perfect house for my family with her aggressive and keen strategies. Speaking of extra mile, Jenna showed me a property literally the day before her wedding, and she probably had her wedding dress in her trunk during that showing. It's rare to find that kind of dedication in a real estate agent. Jenna was also giving me a moral boost when I was about to give up after getting shot down in multiple bidding situations. She is an expert in local real estate knowledge, and she also has an excellent network with high quality specialists such as attorney, inspector, etc. I highly recommend Jenna to anyone who is looking into buying a house.</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Youn C., First-Time Home Buyer</p><br>

      <h4>I can't recommend Jenna enough, she helped us find the home we wanted and was extremely professional and knowledgeable along the way. When it seemed like it wouldn't be possible, she was patient and calm, and the perfect home came available. Through her hard work and hustle we were able to get our offer in after hours and beat other offers to the table. Thanks Jenna-Leigh!</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Jonathan C., Relocation Home Buyer</p><br>

      <h4>Jenna-Leigh was amazing to work with! I was a first time home buyer who knew nothing about the process of buying a home. During my initial meeting with Jenna-Leigh, she gradually talked me through each step of the process and explained everything in such a way that made complete sense to me. Any questions I had going in, quickly went away. She was able to connect me with a mortgage lender, who helped me determine my price range. I then perused the many listings on-line that Jenna-Leigh had narrowed down for me, based on my wish-list, to come up with the list of properties I wanted to see firsthand. She promptly set up visits to the homes I wanted to see all in one day, which was great, because it was easy to compare them. While on the site visits she thoroughly explained what things to look for (when was the last time the roof/HVAC/water heater/etc... were replaced) and what things should be considered "red flags". I continually learned something new after each encounter with Jenna-Leigh. I quickly found the perfect house for me and she successfully helped me negotiate the price down to where I needed it to be. I was mostly impressed by her responsiveness throughout the entire process. I would highly recommend Jenna-Leigh to anyone! </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Ted L., First-Time Home Buyer</p><br>

      <h4>We were under a time crunch and she worked hard to help us find a home that fit our criteria in the time frame we needed. Highly recommend her!</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-Lauren S., Home Buyer</p>

      <h4>Jenna was fantastic to work with. She was always available when we needed her. Very reliable, friendly, and knowledgeable. We had a tight time frame to work with and she was very accommodating and helped us find a rental home in the price range and area we were looking for. We love Jenna!</h4>
